# Attack Input Swap

## What this is:

An SKSE plugin that swaps your Left / Right hand controls when attacking. Requested for accessibility reasons.

By default, your "Left Hand" keybind swings your Right Hand, and your "Right Hand" keybind swings your Left Hand. This is kind of weird. This plugin offers two solutions. You can download the "ALL" version which will swap these for all attack inputs (One Handed, Dual Wield, Spell, Bow, Crossbow, etc). Or you can select the "TWO HAND" version which will only change behaviors for Bows, Crossbows, and Two Handed Weapons.
